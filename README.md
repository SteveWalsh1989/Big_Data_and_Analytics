#   Lab1:   Mine Sweeper program
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Input The first line contains two integers N and M, 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000,
# corresponding to the the height and width of the map respectively.
# The next N lines contain M space-separated characters.
# Each character is either an x if this cell contains a mine,
# or o to represent an empty cell.
#
# Output The output consists of N lines of M space-separated characters. Each
# character either encodes for the number of adjacent cells containing mines,
# or the character ’x’ if the cell itself contains a mine.
#
# EX:
# Sample Input 1     Sample Output 1
# 3 5                   1 x 3 x 3
# o x o x o             1 1 3 x x
# o o o x x             0 0 1 2 2
# o o o o o
